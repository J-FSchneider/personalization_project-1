    "# Recommender System Final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "**The main purpose of this notebook is to understand how incorporating time awareness and adding various audio features can improve the accuracy of the recommender system that was develop to help Deezer in the first part of the project**. On one hand, intuitively, time of the day or day of the week should affect the music selection of the user. For example, if a user works out in the morning, then a genre like EMD with a higher tempo might be the best option. However on a Sunday morning, while reading a novel, a less energetic genre might be the most suitable option. On the other hand, being able to differentiate songs by more audio features should, in principle, aid the recommender system on discriminating better the preferences for each user. **Finally, to get a closer understanding of the performance of our recommender system, we incorporated our close friend's music preferences into the data set and created recommendations for them. We then discussed how satisfied they were with the recommendations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The notebook consists on the following sections** (each with the aim of answering a key question)\n",
    "* **_Introduction_**: will time awareness and audio features improve our recommendations?\n",
    "* **_Approach_**: how can we incorporate time awareness and audio features into our recommendations?\n",
    "* **_Validation_**: how were the hyper parameters tuned? what did our friends think about our recommendations?\n",
    "* **_Conclusions_**: what are the shortcomings of the approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note : the previous \"project report\" complements this notebook. We do not discuss the problem context or the previous models that were develop in detail anymore. Please re-read key sections for a refresher in those topics._"

    "From the above plot it can be seen that activity peaks in two times of the day (hence creating three natural splits). **Beyond the data analysis, there is also a domain knowledge justification for these time splits**. In France (as in most western countries), the work schedule separates the day into three parts. The first encompasses the time period (5AM - 9AM) where the users do their pre-work activities. The second is throughout their work time (9AM - 5PM) and the last being after work (>5PM). Based on this, it makes sense that the _type_ of music that a user listens is related to the time of the day that he is in. We are going to show the activity of user 3466 to illustrate these nuances."

    "**The main question we address by measuring listening activity is if users change the songs that they listened to throughout the day.** This plays a key role for justifying our approach. **If the majority of the users are stuck with a certain group of songs, playing them all day long, then making the recommender system time aware would not yield any improvements.** An example of this behavior was seen above by user 7. No matter what time of the day it was, she always played Lana del Rey's \"Born to Die\"; moreover, all the top songs of that user showed the same behavior. Hence, the time of the day for this user only helps to understand when this user is more likely to log-in into the app, but the listening patterns remain fixed. On the opposite side of the spectrum we have cases like user 3466 which did vary the energy levels of the songs through the day. **Therefore, what profile is more common in the data?**"

    "**The approach used to measure the listening activity is the following.** **First, we determined which are the relevant time periods of each user.** If a user never logs-in into the app on the evenings then that time period was filter out when analyzing her listening behavior. Actually, any time period that accounted for less that 5% of the user's listening activity was taken out for robustness purposes in our calculations. **Then, we looked for the songs that were played across all the time periods.** Going back to our users example, for user 7 we included Lana del Rey's song in the computation since it was played through all the relevant time periods. But for user 3466, none of the top three songs were included in the analysis since they where only played in specific time periods and not across all. We understand that this is a strict requirement but it provides us with a direct answer of whether a user is playing the same songs or not through the day. **Finally, we gave each user a score based on how consistently he/she played the same songs throughout all time periods.** No user is black or white. Even user 7 has some songs that were not played through all the time periods; same for user 3488. The score measures the % of the listening activity that was played throughout all time periods. **For the % of listening activity, we calculate the number of times that a song was played throughout the month and divide that number by the total of songs played in that time frame** (a numerical example will be provided below).

Hence it makes no sense to require that a song gets also played in this time bucket to say that it is consistently played over time. However, if she plays the same song in the morning and the afternoon, then it is actually the case that she is playing the same songs consistently. On the other hand, for user 2 it also seems counter intuitive to add into the analysis the afternoon/evening period. Roughly 4% of his activity concentrates there, which almost seems like noise or non-recurrent events. On the contrary, there are users like 1 for whom all time periods are relevant and hence the measurement accounts for all of them."

    "Once the relevant time periods for each user are determined, **we find the songs that were played across all time periods by easily checking whether the song has a positive amount of plays in each time bucket.** Again, if a user does not play a song in a certain time period (and it is relevant) then we can argue that he is not listening to the same music throughout all the day. Especially for the relevant songs. If the _most listened song_ does not appear in a certain time bucket then it does hint that it is more suitable for certain times of the day or, at the very least, that the user alters his listening behavior depending on time. Analyzing an opposite scenario, if the song has at least one play in each time bucket then we will say that that song was played in that time frame. It might seem over optimistic to assert that a song that was played only once in a certain time bucket should be considered as being consistently listened to in that time period. However, we do not correct for this fact since, even with the over estimation, the consistency results are low at the aggregate level "

We matched the song name and artist name from the Deezer Dataset, querried the Spotify_ID and retrieved additional features (described below) from the spotify API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main motivation for doing so is twofold. First, **we want to help the recommender system by giving it more features to discriminate**. Second, **we want to understand how _diverse_ are the recommendations that we are providing to the user**. For example, with the addtion of these features we can determine if the majority of the recommendations for a user come from a single genre or if they are all energetic songs.\n",

    "The list of features added into the model is quite large. However, **below are the ones that we were most interested in**. We provide a brief definition and also a rational on why they are relevant.\n",
    "* **_Energy_**: As explained in the last section, this feature measures the perceptual intensity of a song in a (0, 1) scale. This feature is relevant for the analysis since some moments of the day / activities are more suitable for more energetic music. \n",
    "* **_Danceability_**: This feature measures how suitable a track is for dancing; it combines overall regularity and rhythm stability. It is also in a (0, 1) scale. This feature is relevant again due to its connection with day of the week. More \"danceable\" songs are more appealing for a Saturday night than for a Monday morning.\n",
    "* **_Tempo_**: This feature is simply the BPM of a song. This feature is relevant since it would help us understand how a user might like or dislike slow paced songs. Also, this featured is linked to the two previous ones.\n",
    "* **_Valence_**: This feature measures the \"positiveness\" conveyed by the track. It is measure in a (0, 1) scale and a higher number reflects happy and cheerful songs while a lower sad or depressed notes. This feature is relevant to understand more deeply the music selection of a user. Two users might like the hip-hop genre; however one can prefer more a Kanye West style while the other something like the Wu-Tang Clan. In this scenario, valence would help us further discriminate the user on how \"strong\" their hip-hop music preferences are.\n",
    "* **_Speechiness_**: This feature detects the presence of spoken words in the track. It is also measured in a (0, 1) scale, where values lesser than 0.33 come from songs that contain no spoken words whereas values over 0.66 of songs based on mostly spoken words (rap). This feature is relevant since it would allow us to understand how much a user is into songs that contain vocals rather than just simply music beats."

We tried other approaches, however, this yielded the best results (or at least _a_ result that ran on our computers). **In terms of the audio features, we trained different classifiers in order to get two main insights**. First, which are the audio features that discriminated our users best and, second, what are the biases in our data.

    "* **Eventhough strong french rap is listened frequently in the data set, it is not a good recommendation to make**. We hypothesize two reasons. One is that users that like this music do not want to have it as a recommendation, they are already into that; however, another user whom is distant to that genre might find this recommendation too aggressive. The direct implication for our recommender system is to filter out restrain the presence of this type of songs in our top-k lists.\n",
    "* **Genre and gender showed a connection**. Girls appear to have a biased towards french pop artists (like Marina Kaye) while they digressed from rap artists. This goes back to the previous point, if the recommender system does not put genre into the picture, then it is not surprising that women were prone to dislike explicit rap content. The implication for our recommender system is to select top items from genres that are more suitable to the genre at hand.\n",
    "* **Audio features by themselves say nothing**. This point was at first counterintuitive, but we have a belief of why this is the case. By itself, audio features are not what users choose to listen. It is not the case that a user says, \"I feel like listening to energetic music\", but rather that he feels like listening to certain songs. Thus, in this process of creating a list of songs to listen, the user might unintentionally add a less energetic song into the session. Even though it is the case that a Monday morning might contain more energetic songs (as we saw with the data analysis) this unintentional variation of the energy levels that the user introduces generates so much noise in the model that it is not able to discriminate by these features alone.\n",

    "**Accuracy might not be the most appropriate measure to evaluate the quality of a recommender system.** Thus we surveyed our close friends to gather their thoughts about our recommendations. The idea stems from the inherent difficulty in testing the accuracy of recommender systems. Testing against past ratings can only take one so far, we wanted to go one step ahead and see the recommendations that we were making and how people were reacting to the same. We queried the Deezer API to get the names of our songs. **We constructed the survey with 65 popular songs and asked our friends to rate the songs 1 if they liked it, 0 if they did not, and N/A if they had not heard the song.** Then, for the songs that the users had rated 1, we asked them about the time that they are most likely to listen to those songs. This was a very important step as we were making a time sensitive model and getting context information was very important.  Finally, we were successfully able to collect data for 30 users. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The next step in the process had a heavy data cleaning component**. Data found from surveys, in the open, is typically messy and is seldom in a form that can be directly used for the analysis. These steps included matching the songs names with the ‘unique_id’s’, formatting the time of day the song was listened to and removing redundancies. The data was finally in the format that was in sync with our original data and thus, could be appended with our dataset. We then ran our models on this new dataset and got the top-k recommendations for all users including the users in the survey. The next step was arguably the most exciting one: we took these top-k recommendations to our friends who had filled the survey and took feedback about the recommendations that we provided. \n",

    "**We feel that doing this user test gave a new dimension to our recommendation system and helped us learn more about the subtleties for how the recommendations happen.** There were interesting results where we saw that many a times the system would recommend all songs from the same genre to a user, we tried to get this redundancy out by filtering for this. \n",

    "**Adding time into the model proved to be more difficult than suspected.** We point two main reasons for this. **First it introduced really high sparseness in our models**. If the input matrix already had many missing entries -without splitting the data into different time buckets- now asking for (user, time) combinations only worsened the problem. Hence, estimating all (user, time) combinations jointly was prohibitive with our computer resources. Moreover, such high index of sparseness would not guarantee convergence. **Second, we had to resort to other metrics to evaluate performance; accuracy was not the best guidance in this context.** By incorporating different time profiles per user, we were at odds with increasing accuracy. However, we did accomplish what we intended; a RecSys that outputs a different top-k list for each time of the day. To better understand the quality of this list we surveyed our close friends to get a qualitative feel of our recommendations. **Eventhough the accuracy was 50%, we were able to generate a different list of recommendations per each time of the day.** Personally, I did like the recommendation of starting the day with Bon Jovi and then relaxing in the evening with Happy by Pharell.

    "**The main shortcoming of our approach is that we discard information**. We do so by narrowing the data to consider only the data points of the time period for which we are developing the recommendations. It could be the case that a user in the morning is more similar to a user at night (going to GYM in the morning vs at night) and hence we are discarting the possibility of the model to use this information. **Finally, our use of the audio features seems \"too manual\"**. We created a classifier on top of our recommender system in order to filter out recommendations which did not had a good change of success (when considering also audio features and other user characteristics: age, gender, time). However, we are doing so after those songs have already made it into the top-k list. We would prefer a model in which those songs do not make it into that list in the first place."
